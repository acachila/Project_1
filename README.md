# BACKGROUND:
In the midst of our national opioid crisis, recommendations have encouraged judicious stewardship of opioid prescription through the expanded use of non-opioid analgesic medications. Trends of opioids have been well documented; however, these data have limited information in regard to provider practice variation. Therefore, the primary aim of our study is to identify prescribing provider practice variation using a large national database. The second aim of our study is to compare these data with a national overdose dataset to identify potential patterns in prescribing and overdose rates. 

# METHODS:
Study Design
A cross-sectional, retrospective review will be conducted using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and national overdose data. CMS data presents information on the individual opioid prescribing rates of health providers that participate 2013-2016. These data is a prescriber-level data set that provides data on the number and percentage of prescription claims (includes new prescriptions and refills) for opioid drugs, and contains information on each providerâ€™s name, specialty, state, and ZIP code. Secondary overdose dataset contains summaries of prescription records for 250 common opioid and non-opioid drugs written by 25,000 unique licensed medical professionals in 2014 in the United States for citizens.
